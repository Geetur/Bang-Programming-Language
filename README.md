# Bang
Bang is an interpreted, procedural programming language for algorithmic design/prototypes, or small-scale projects. Bang was created with an emphasis on the developer; it is meant for developers to prototype algorithms, functions, programs, etc. rapidly, and then translate into a more robust language.

Features of Bang are:

| **Features**  | **Description**                                                                                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Types**     | Bang currently supports boolean, integer, and float data types with strings on the horizon.          |
| **Expressions** | Bang supports robust mathematical and logical expressions, with a full suite of operators including [+, -, *, /, ^, !, &&] etc. (unary negation and positive is supported though [+,-]). |
| **Variables** | Bang supports dynamically typed user variables with the "=" operator. Variables can be used anywhere a constant value is allowed (in conditions, expressions, loops, etc.). |
| **Conditions** | Bang supports conditional expressions with the [if, elif, else, endif] keywords, which can be paired with any type of expression/value via implicit type conversion. |
| **Loops**     | Bang supports loops via the [for, while, endf, endw] keywords. The for loop requires a variable iterator definition and an end-range value (e.g., 10). The while loop requires a condition. |
| **Upcoming**  | Functions, lists, hashmaps, tuple assignments, explicit/implicit expression-assignments, and built-in functions. |
